Set Up
* Client requests access to program
* Server reads segments from elf file and passes virtual memory address ranges to client
* Client takes note
* Client spawns Inferior from a newly created mostly-empty ELF file, that describes the same
	vmem ranges as the Server's ELF file
* Client attaches to Inferior with ptrace()
* Client requests initial code in request thread
* Client places code in appropriate memory
* Client protects Unexplored regions with mprotect()

* Client resumes inferior
* On access to Unexplored:
	Client requests block and fills block
	Client unprotects region


No instruction modification needed!
No vmem translation needed!
